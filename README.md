# Technical_Analysis_Indicators_with_Python

In this repository, I have tried to implement some of the commonly used Technical Analysis Indicators using basic Python programming.

Below is the list of Technical Indicators i have added included (Note: I plan on adding some more indicators to the notebook)

1. Moving Average
2. Exponential Moving Average
3. Bollinger Bands
4. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

All the implementation is dynamic as data for any stock can be imported using the get_data_yahoo API. Moreover, the indicators can also be modified using by changing the parameters in the defined functions for each indicator.

Libraries Used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Math
- Pandas Datareader
